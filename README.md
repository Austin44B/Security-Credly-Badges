In earning the security+ [Architecture](https://www.credly.com/badges/9ddeae94-82bf-41bd-839c-85ea9f7ac746/public_url) badge :

I learned to use common network tools such as local commands and Nmap to discover hosts on the local network. I conducted banner grabbing to identify specific services and used DNS tools for name resolution. Additionally, I utilized Wireshark and tcpdump to capture network traffic and interpret the output for security assessments. I registered and configured a RADIUS client with an existing RADIUS server, configured network policies, set role-based access and tested access. I also worked with iptables in Linux to configure firewall rules and examine firewall access log files. 


The Comptia Security+ Architecture badge covers exam objectives in sections : 3.3, 3.8, and 4.1.

In earning the security+ [Automation](https://www.credly.com/badges/1fb829fc-030e-4445-8bed-596c1046be5a/public_url) badge : 

I Learned how to Analyze potential indicators associated with network attacks, By configuring an internal Windows webserver for HTTPS connectivity, providing a secure connection to an internal web application then configured DHCP security settings, including Authorization, an IP address reservation, and audit logs.
 
  Implemented secure protocols to display and confirm network time services in Active Directory, configure Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) service settings, and test for secure zone transfer settings in Domain Name System (DNS).
 
  Applied mitigation techniques and controls to secure an environment, by organizing Active Directory objects for Group Policy, and then used the Group Policy AppLocker to manage software installation and execution.
 
  And implemented host and application security solutions, to harden administrator accounts and workstations that required creating a fine-grained password policy that enforces stricter password setting than the Default Domain Policy, these settings were then applied to an IT-specific Global group, where I then used Group Policy to configure several security-oriented settings, in which the GPO created from this was linked to an Organizational Unit in Active Directory where IT computer accounts reside.
 
The Comptia Security+ Automation badge covers exam objectives in sections : 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 4.4

In earning the security+ [Governance, Risk & Compliance](https://www.credly.com/badges/6319b459-6cdb-44da-ad4e-1d8402bdd392/public_url) badge :

I Learned how to explore the properties of digital certificates and use Windows to request certificates to implement public key infrastructure for working with OpenSSL when managing certificates, generating certificates, generating a certificate signing request, and converting certificate formats. I also implemented identity and account management controls to display processes running on the server, confirm applied Group Policy Objects, and then use Group Policy Objects to configure auditing. These tasks demonstrated to me administrators responsibilities when managing web servers, email servers, and other devices.

The Comptia Security+ Governance, Risk & Compliance badge covers exam objectives in sections : 3.7 and 3.9

In earning the Security+ [Infrastructure](https://www.credly.com/badges/aa20edca-f8d4-4f48-b433-383fe0223c61/public_url) badge : 

I learned how to configure an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and then initiated a Ethical Denial of Service (DoS) attack against a Windows server. while monitoring the DOS via a real time tool called SGUIL which is a Security Onion Linux distribution (securityonion'.'net) that is bundled with a Snort IDS sensor I was able to view and analyze log files.

I then configured a Windows VPN server with a network access policy, configured a Windows VPN client, test VPN connectivity and scanned the VPN server for open ports. 

I also tested basic SSH connectivity, and implemented a SSH security configurations test. and configured SSH key-based authentication and reviewed log files. 

And finally I configured backups to remote storage for both Windows and Linux, and restored lost data from the remote systems. 

The CompTia Security+ Infrastructure badge covers exam objectives in sections, 2.5, 3.3, 4.1![image](https://github.com/Austin44B/Security-Credly-Badges/assets/134319619/fdb041cf-c8c3-4a1d-8270-aeca98fd65f3)
